# UVC Flexing Modeler
## Easy & Simple OPC Modeler.
  This project, which started to overcome the hard to use traditional OPC modellers, has finally been opened.
  Before we introduce our products, <b>Do you know OPC?</b> Yes. you may know about that. I change my question, <b>Can you make your own server?</b> This question may be hard to answer. So was I. It's very hard to make my own server.
  Our project helps you make your own server. Details, You can make your own model by using our tool. And then, just upload model file to your own server. In this process, modelling helps you that you can make your own server.
  
## DIFFERENCE
  Let's look at the existing products first. You may think the most popular OPC modeler is UA Modeler. This product's UI is excellent and specification is powerful. There will be no room for this opinion. But, <b>Is it easy?</b> My answer is NO. If you are beginner of OPC, this tool may be hard to use and give up trying to understand. It's not your fault, also UA's fault. It's OPC's fault. (sorry OPC Foundation). Now that I've had a long talk, I'll get to the point.
  
1. First, you can edit using diagram tool.
  You can make your own model by using powerful diagram tool. And if you have understood UML, you may not have difficult using this tool. just connect diagrams, make model. that's all!
2. Second, you can export models to server which is in modeller's server.
  After modelling, you may want to check models status. Click the export button, and check the Modeler server status. 
3. Third, you can check model's value in realtime.
  Modelling makes you wonder how my model works. You just click the client view, and drag the node which you want to check value. That view makes you to see the value.
